# gRunner
Minimal GTK4 application launcher.
## Project status:
**Stalled!** I'm waiting on the next GTK release since there's no sane way (as far as I know) to handle keyboard shortcuts, especially redirecting "global" shortcuts for accessibility (TAB, <Shift>TAB). Work will resume later on however.
